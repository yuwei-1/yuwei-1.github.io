    <p class="text paragraph">My name is Yuwei. I recently completed my BSc Physics degree at UCL with first class honours,
      and I am looking forward to starting my MSc Machine Learning course this september.
        <br><br>
        I am currently working on a number of personal projects, with the goal of improving my knowledge of full stack development,
        computer science and machine learning.

          <p class="hidden text paragraph">The Login App is the first "proper" purely personal project I have taken on. The main objective of this
            project was to improve my ability of writing Object-Oriented code. Starting off, I had a basic idea of what I wanted to build -
            knowing that along the way I would find more and more features to add and improve on. I chose to use Python, due to it being my
            strongest and most used programming language thus far.
            <br></br>
            I wrote all of the code (which can be found <a href="https://github.com/yuwei-1/login_app" target="_blank">here</a>) using the
            AGILE development method - a snippet of my sprint logs is shown below.

        <div>
          <button type="button" class="sub-collapsible text">GUI</button>
          <p class="hidden text paragraph"> The GUI I used for my App was created using a framework built in to the standard library provided
            by Python - Tkinter. Using Tkinter sometimes gives the UI a very outdated/clunky look, however, it is easy for new users to pick
            up in a short time. The main page, a Tk() object, is the login page (shown below), where existing users can login in. The other pages used by
            the app open as Toplevel() objects that "stem" from the login page.
            <br></br>
            <img src="images/Login_app/GUI1.jpg" class="images">
            <br></br>
            If you are not an existing user, there is an option to register an account with the app. After choosing this option, the user will be asked
            to provide several details: a new username, password and email address.
            <br></br>
            <img src="images/Login_app/GUI2.jpg" class="images">
            <br></br>
            Upon successful registration, an email will be sent to your email address, and a success message will be displayed to the user.
            The user can now proceed to log in to the app.
            <br></br>
            <img src="images/Login_app/GUI3.jpg" class="images">

            <img src="images/Login_app/GUI4.jpg" class="images">
            <br></br>
            If the username and password both match an account on the system, the app will then prompt the user for a 6 digit code, sent to the
            email address they signed up with. (2FA process described in next section)
            <br></br>

            <br></br>
            If the user enters the code correctly, they will reach the landing page of the login app. Here, their username and email address will
            displayed. The background is a reference to the TV show Mr. Robot.

          <div class="hidden">
            <p class="text paragraph">This section will talk about the 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) used within the app and the basic security
            measures used to make the app more secure, and to protect users. The entire process is very simple, and starts off by concatenating 6 random
            integers into a code and sending this to the user's email address, whilst simultaneously prompting the user to enter the aforementioned code.
            Then, these can simply be compared - resulting in successful login if they are same, and rejecting sign in if otherwise. In order to add
            2FA to the app, discovery work was done into sending emails using the built in Python library, smtplib. In particular, I used the class
            smtplib.SMTP_SSL(); the code for the mail sending function is shown below.
            <br></br>
            <img src="images/Login_app/2FA1.jpg" class="images">
            <br></br>
            I will now briefly describe the process carried out by this code.
            <br>
            A link is established to a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, here the
            specific one used is owned by Google, the address being: "smtp.gmail.com". After using method .login(), and providing correct details to a valid
            gmail account, an email can be sent. The email and other details, such as recipient's address is sent over to the host address corresponding to the
            SMTP server. The SMTP server will then contact the DNS server in order to find the recipient's IP address.The SMTP server finally sends the information
            to email recipient's Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) server. Then, using either POP or IMAP protocols (depending on recipients email client) the email
            will arrive at the recipient's inbox. The whole process is done using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which creates an encrypted
            connection, making sure that in the unlikely case the email is intercepted midway, hackers cannot access the information within the email.
            <br></br>
            Aside from 2FA, the app requires users to create a password that adheres to standard requirements:
            </p>

            <ul class="paragraph combine">
              <li> Password must be at least 8 characters in length.</li>
              <li> Password must contain a Capital letter.</li>
              <li> Password must contain a special character.</li>
              <li> Password must contain a number.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text paragraph combine">
            If the user fails to meet these requirements, the app will reject the password and prompt the user to strengthen the password.
            <br></br>
            <img src="images/Login_app/security1.jpg" class="images">
            <br></br>
            Additionally, passwords that are stored on the database are hashed using SHA-256. This adds extra steps for a hacker that gets access
            to the database. If they try to brute force the password, they will need to apply the hash every attempt in order to find the correct
            password, which is more time consuming. The algorithm is described in more detail in the next section.

        <div>
          <button type="button" class="sub-collapsible text">SHA-256 Algorithm</button>
          <p class="hidden text paragraph">This section will briefly go over the Secure Hashing Algorithm(SHA) - 256, implemented from scratch to be
            used to hash passwords in the Login app. Information in this section can be found in its entirety
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">here</a>, in the pseudocode section.
            <br></br>
            Below, you can see the main method implemented in my class, SHA2, called .encrypt().
            <br></br>
            <img src="images/Login_app/SHA21.jpg" class="images">
            <br></br>
            Walking through the steps within this method, first there is a method called binary conversion. This simply takes the password string,
            and converts each character to binary. Next, the binary string is "padded" with zeros and the message length (also in binary) so that
            we end up with a 512-bit binary string.
            <br></br>
            The next two steps are very related, so they shall be described together. In SHA-256 hashing, there are 64 so called W values, which
            are used in "rounds". The first 16 W values, labelled 0 to 15, are created using your initial message, splitting up the 512-bits into
            16 x 32-bit chunks. Then, after these have been obtained, the algorithm will proceed to iterate 64 minus 16 times to "generate" the rest
            of the W values. This is using the formula below:
            <br></br>
            <img src="images/Login_app/SHA22.jpg" class="images">
            <br></br>
            Which uses functions for right rotate (switching order of bits) and right shift (removing bits and padding with zeros), as well as existing
            W values to find new W values. After this is completed, 64 "rounds" will commence.
            <br></br>
            The diagram of a single round is shown below.
            <br></br>
            <img src="images/Login_app/SHA23.png" class="images">
            <br></br>
            A to H at the top represent "working variables". Using a number of different functions: maj, conditional, Sigma, combined with our W values
            and K values (created using cube roots of first 64 prime numbers) using modular addition, these working variables are then used to initialize
            the working variables of the next round. This is repeated 64 times to retrieve the final set of working variables. Adding these to the initial
            working variables and converting to hexadecimal, and finally concatentating, we retrieve the SHA256 hash.
            <br></br>
            Unittests were written to test the validity of hash function.
