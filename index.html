      My name is Yuwei. My academic background consists of a MSc in Machine Learning, and a BSc in Physics.
      I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Alloyed, a company which specialises in manufacturing
      parts and crafts materials for niche use cases.
      <br></br>
      My current interests lie in Bayesian Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and
      algorithmic trading.
      <br></br>
      I also enjoy long distance running, competitive coding, reading and general ML research.
